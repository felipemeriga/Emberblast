## Game Rules

You basically need to select a job and a race for your character, each job and races
has their own skills and attributes points, you will start in a random position of the map,
and the goal of Deathmatch, it's being the last one to survive on the field.

The game flows into turns, where each of the characters will have to decision between the following actions:
- Move
- Attack
- Defend
- Item
- Hide
- Search
- Skill

In each turn, each player is allowed to move, plus one of the another remaining actions.

The maps are compounded by tiles, represented by a graph, each vertex of a graph is one tile, and characters move on top of them.

By executing actions, characters levels up, increasing their attributes, and learning new skills.
